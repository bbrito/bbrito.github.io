I had the pleasure to do my master in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Porto! I have a Master Degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Porto (Portugal) in 2013. During my studies I was lucky to see my work rewarded several times, such as the ABB and Continental prize for the best master thesis.

After my master I was in love with "Space" so, I decided to give my first steps outside of the university in European Space Agency (ESA). I was a trainee in the Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) section for 2 years where start researching about Space Robotics for space debris removal and Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations.





Afterwards, he was a researcher engineer and scientist in the Department “Robot and Assistive Systems” at Fraunhofer IPA from 2016 till 2018. His research is mainly focused in safe manipulation and safe human-robot interaction.
